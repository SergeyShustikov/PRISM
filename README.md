<b>PRISM is the Flutter architecture framework. The name PRISM is short for Provider, Router, Interactor, Screen and Model which are core components of this architecture. This framework is designed for mobile apps with a large number of engineers and nested states.</b>


<br>The PRISM architecture provides:

- Flexible architecture across Flutter projects.
- Testability and Isolation. Classes must be easy to unit test and reason about in isolation. Individual PRISM classes have distinct responsibilities like: routing, business, view logic, creation. Plus, most PRISM logic is decoupled from child PRISM logic. This makes PRISM classes easy to test and reason about independently.
Tooling for developer productivity. 
- An architecture that scales. This architecture has proven to scale to hundreds of engineers working on the same codebase and apps with hundreds of RIBs.
